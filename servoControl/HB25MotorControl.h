 *  Parallax HB-25 (Part Number: #29144) 
 *  Motor Controller Library
 *
 *  Written By: David Such (Reefwing Software - http://www.reefwing.com.au/)
 *  Version:  1.0
 *  Date:     11th October 2015
 *
 *  Version History:
 *    1.0   11/10/15  Original release
 *
 *  Wiring:
 *    1.  If you are using the Parallax Motor Mount and wheel kits (part numbers
 *      #28962 - aluminium or #28963 - plastic) then the red cable should be 
 *      connected to M1 on the HB-25 and the blue cable should be connected to
 *      M2. If these are reversed then the FORWARD and REVERSE commands will be 
 *      reversed.
 *    2.  Make sure that the jumper is in place for mode 1 operation.
 *
 *  Notes:
 *    1.  Library currently only supports mode 1 operation of the HB-25. In this
 *      mode, you need a separate digital output for each HB-25 that you want to
 *      control.
 *    2.  The HB-25 operates like a servo. You only need to send a single pulse (in mode 1)
 *      to change direction or speed. Pulse width determines the HB-25 output.
 *    3.  Valid pulse widths are 0.8 ms to 2.2 ms. If the HB-25 receives a pulse width
 *      which is outside this range, the motor will be stopped until it receives a 
 *      valid pulse.
 *    4.  The minimum time between pulses (HOLD_OFF_TIME) is 5.25 ms + pulse time (max 2.2 ms).
 *      Thus the worst case hold off time needs to be 7.45 ms. We have used 8 ms.
 *    5.  The maximum time between pulse is unlimited, since a single pulse will be latched
 *      by the HB-25. An exception to this would be if the Communication Timeout feature of
 *      the HB-25 has been enabled. You can read more about this on the HB-25 data sheet 
 *      (https://www.parallax.com/downloads/hb-25-motor-controller-product-documentation).
 *    6.  Regardless of the mode, the HB-25 signal pin should be brought low immediately upon
 *      power up. The Library does this when you instantiate a HB25MotorControl object.
 *    7.  Pulse Input (1 ms = 1000 microseconds):
 *        1.0 ms  Full Reverse
 *        1.5 ms  Neutral (STOP)
 *        2.0 ms  Full Forward
 *    8.  Valid speed ranges for the forwardAtSpeed and reverseAtSpeed methods are
 *      0 (stop) to 500 (maximum speed). For moveAtSpeed & rampToSpeed you can use from -500 (full
 *      reverse) to 500 (full forward). As before, a speed of 0 will stop the motor.
